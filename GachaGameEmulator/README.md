# A Gacha game emulator

## Functionality of this project-: 

- *NOTE: throughout the project I use the terms Card and Unit interchangeably, they have the same meaning here.*

- "Gacha games are video games that implement the gacha mechanic. This is somewhat similar to loot boxes, inducing 
players to spend in-game currency to receive a random virtual item. Most of these games are free-to-play mobile games, 
where the gacha serves as an incentive to spend real-world money. (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game)"  
The application will simulate a mobile gacha game experience (as a desktop java app), where you get to summon for units 
you really want in your collection. The summoning system will have specific rates for certain rarities of each unit. 
You can then remove units from your collection that you don't like, or change the order in which your units are 
displayed, i.e. by order of rarity, or the category they belong to, or both. Then you can feel proud of your 
collection. You can have multiple Collections, which will be stored in a list of Collections. 

## Intended Audience-:

- Any Gacha game or card collecting enthusiast will enjoy this application, and especially those that are fans of characters
from **MARVEL**, **NARUTO** and **DRAGON BALL**.

## Project Inspiration-:

- I have loved collection card games since I was 8, from physical ones "**WWE Slam ATTAX**", "**Marvel HERO ATTAX**", to 
games simulated in mobile apps, such as "**Dragon Ball Z: *Dokkan Battle***","**NARUTO: *Ultimate Ninja Blazing***", and
"**Dragon Ball Legends**". The feeling after getting your favorite character, even more so as a card of the highest 
rarity in the game is indescribable, that surge of dopamine can stay with you for days, even weeks. However, for these
games, real money is a huge differentiator in how much you can enjoy the game. With physical cards, the only way you can 
participate in this activity is if you buy card packets with real money, which are very cheap back in India, but here 
it makes my wallet run away out of my pocket, so I haven't even dared to do so in years. It's a lot easier to do with 
the mobile games, since they are free to play, however since the rates for pulling "cards" of certain rarities are
pretty low, buying in game currency to "get" more "card packs" makes the game more fun, however this is very similar to
gambling where you're investing in just a tiny chance of getting something you want, and there's a high chance all that
money will just get wasted, so I don't invest there either. With this game I aim to create, in game currency required to
"get" "card packs" will not require any real money to buy, there's no currency, summon for free, which makes this a small
way of enjoying the same experience of getting characters you want without possibly feeling guilty about it.
